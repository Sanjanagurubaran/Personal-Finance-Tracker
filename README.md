💰 Personal Finance Tracker – Project Description

It helps users easily manage and monitor their income and expenses.

🔐 Login & Registration System
Users can register, login securely, and manage their sessions.

🔑 Forgot Password & Change Password
If a user forgets their password, they can reset it. Logged-in users can also change their password.

Allows users to define custom income and expense categories with subcategories.

💵 Income Page
Users can add income entries with category, subcategory, amount, and date. The data is grouped and displayed month-wise.

💸 Expense Page
Users can log expenses with category, subcategory, amount, and date. Expenses are also grouped by date ranges, and all data is saved and visible.

📊 Visual Reports
The system can generate bar or pie charts using Chart.js for expense distribution by category.

🧠 Smart UI
Dropdowns update dynamically: for example, selecting a category automatically shows the matching subcategories.
